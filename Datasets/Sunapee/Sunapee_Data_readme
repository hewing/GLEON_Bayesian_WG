Read me file for Sunapee Data

Raw data  = original Sunapee shared for workshop with no edits beyond what Shannon did for the weekly summary she made

R work = working R directory folder with copy of raw data
  
  Level 1 = JAB modified data
  * Most important change -> I removed duplicate samples from the same day and/or week from Shannon's weekly summary document for the gloeo observations and the new file is called Sunapee_weeklysummary_JBedits.xlsx. If you want to do anything with the gloeo data at each site, I would use this file from now on.
