creating a file for any notes on these scripts that we'd like to archive...

Useful functions.Rmd: uses the curve function to make example plots of several commonly used functional forms for ecological modeling. 
You can alter the parameters and range over which the function is plotted to get a sense of how it would behave with your data. :)

bayes_models.R: collection of different models written with JAGs code

get_data.R: function that pulls in gloeo data and water temp data and puts in correct date time format

model_wrapper.R: 

call_model.R:

create_gif.R: creates a gif to plot gloeo forecast through time as an animation

plot_frames.R:

Plots.R:
